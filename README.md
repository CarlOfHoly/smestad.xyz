Here you can find the code for my website, smestad.xyz.

## About the project

It is written with Gatsby as a static site generator tool. Other than that it uses React with Typescript.
It is primarily meant to be for learning, but the end goal will be a functioning portfolio website. 

## Future

Furthermore Im wishing to include login and a dark theme. 

## To run the project 

`git clone`

`npm i`

`gatsby develop`

`npm run start:css`
